# Use Descriptive Names
* A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. 
* A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment
* Be consistent in your names (for example, the names includeSetupAndTeardownPages, includeSetupPages, includeSuiteSetupPage, and includeSetupPage. The similar phraseology in those names allows the sequence to tell a story)
