Interfaces and Implementations

The preceding I, so common in today's legacy wads, is a distraction at best and too much information at worst. 

:-1: bad
```
public interface IShapeFactory {

}

public class ShapeFactoryImp{
	
}

```
:+1: good
```
public interface ShapeFactory {

}

public class ShapeFactoryImp{
	
}
```
